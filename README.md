# Decoding Cellphone Signals

In wireless networks, such as cellular and Wi-Fi networks,
[MIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO) is an essential method of increasing
transmission capacity: it uses multiple antennas to exploit
[multipath propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation).
In one variation,
[coordinated multipoint (CoMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_MIMO),
neighboring cellular base stations jointly process received signals to reduce
transmission-decoding errors.

High-quality decoding techniques are computationally expensive, especially in
dense urban areas, characterized by high noise (low signal-to-noise ratios, SNR)
and load (large numbers of cellphones per base station). Consequently, network
providers are in need of ways to reduce high operational cost and power demand.

This notebook demonstrates the use of a quantum computer in decoding
transmissions in CoMP problems and compares performance to decoding methods
currently in use in cellular networks.

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to
[access Leap’s Solvers](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/sapi_access_basic.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your
Leap account
[here](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/leap_authorization.html).

The notebook can be opened by clicking on the
``01-coordinated-multipoint.ipynb`` file in VS Code-based IDEs.

To run a locally installed notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Problem Formulation

MIMO requires effective and efficient demultiplexing of mutually-interfering
transmissions. Contemporary base stations use linear filters such as
[Matched filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_filter) and
[minimum mean squared error (MMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mean_square_error).
However, these methods perform poorly in dense urban environments as the ratio
of cellphones to base stations and noise increase[[1]](#1). Additionally,
complete (or verifiable) decoding techniques, such as sphere decoding, improve
throughput but demand computational resources that grow exponentially with
network size. Power consumption, therefore, is a problem. A quantum computer, in
contrast, can provide powerful computational abilities with low power needs. To
solve the decoding problem with a quantum computer, you formulate it as a
[binary quadratic model](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/quantum_research/workflow.html).

The decoding problem is to find a sequence of symbols, with the length of the
number of transmitters, that minimizes the difference between the received
signal and the sequence of symbols acted upon by the problem Hamiltonian,
which represents the wireless channels of transmission. That is,

![eq1](_static/eq_armin_y_minus_hv.png)

and the objective function is given by:

![eq2](_static/eq_e_full.png)

with the external summation on the receivers (e.g., base stations), the internal
summations on the transmitters (e.g., cellphones), and the Hermitian transpose
denoted with the dagger symbol.


Reference [[2]](#2) below formulates the transmission-decoding problem as an
Ising model and you can see Ocean software's implementation in
[dimod](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/api_ref_dimod/index.html).

In brief, in the case of BPSK handled by this example, symbols are 1 or -1,
and you can reduce the objective to,

![eq3](_static/eq_e_quadratic.png)

The Ising model's coefficients are then given by,

![eq4](_static/eq_h_j.png)

where superscript Q and I denote imaginary and real parts, respectively.
